## **scrape construct**

Just run `python3 scrape_construct.py` to get a list of [public simulation repositories](https://bitbucket.org/account/user/theconstructcore/projects/PS) from [The Construct](https://bitbucket.org/account/user/theconstructcore/).

Uncomment `clone_repos(all_urls)` in `main()` to have the program clone all the repos in `/home/$USER/code/public_sim`. That is all.
